# Flix-16
Flix-16 is a small project of mine, it implements a small 16-bit processor.

Its instruction set contains 27 instructions, some of which are variations of one another.

It comes with logisim-evolution files and a (somewhat stable) emulator. Have fun messing with it.

Trust me, once you get to the ALU instruction implementation in the source code, you will regret looking at this
My excuse: I was tired and lazy, which isn't really an excuse but eh.
Have fun.

The program in the ROM chip to the left is a simple countdown from 0xff to 0x00 which is being displayed on aforementioned display.
