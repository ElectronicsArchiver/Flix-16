# Flix-16

*My small 16-bit processor.*

</div>

<br>
<br>

## Features

<br>

-   **Emulator Implementation**

    <br>

-   **Logism-Evolution Files**

    <br>

-   **27 Instructions**

    *Some are variations of others.*
    
<br>
<br>

## Beware!

Trust me, once you get to the implementation of <br>
the ALU instructions, you will regret looking at this.

<br>

#### My Excuse

I was tired and lazy, which isn't really an excuse but eh.

***Have fun.***

### 16-Bit ALU

*This Arithmetic Logic Unit is implemented using* <br>
*a carry-cascade style array of  `1 Bit`  ALU's.*

### Test Setup

*The program in the ROM chip to the left is a simple countdown from <br>
`0xff - 0x00`  which is being displayed on aforementioned display.*
