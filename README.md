# Flix-16
Flix-16 is a small project of mine, it implements a small 16-bit processor.

Its instruction set contains 27 instructions, some of which are variations of one another.

Comes with logisim-evolution files and an (unstable imo) emulator. Have fun messing with it.

Trust me, once you get to the ALU instruction implementation in the source code, you don't want to live anymore.
My excuse: I was drunk and tired.
Have fun.
